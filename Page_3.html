    <h0>As an author, you'll need a few things in terms of equipment to get yourself out there into the public eye.</h0>
    <p>Authors will typically write their books on a computer. The type of computer isn't really a huge deal, but anything that
    can run something simple like Scrivener, Ulysees, or even Google Docs will work. Having a place to write on the go like a laptop
    or tablet is a good idea too.</p>

    <p> Having spell-check software such as Grammarly also wouldn't hurt. The more presentable your work is, the better
      the publishers will like it!</p>

    <p>A printer also helps out just in general to get a physical copy of any of your work, particularly for your portfolio if you are
      looking to impress a publisher.</p>
