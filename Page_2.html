    <h1>Writing Ability</h1>
    <p>In reality their is no barrier for how literate you need to be in order to write a book. However, most publishers that you need
      to speak to in order to get your book published want it to at least be understandable to the audience you are writing for. Things
      such as punctuation, where to put paragraphs and chapters, necessary details in dialouge, and (most importantly) the ability to
      make a compelling and interesting story.</p>

    <p>But despite the ability any person has to just send a publisher a book and hope they get lucky, their is plenty of education you
      can go through to become an offical author. Universities and some high schools offer degrees in writing. Getting a degree in
      English also helps. Doing things such as school newspapers, writing articles, and pitching ideas to publishers can get you familiar
      with the publishing world.</p>

      <p>Aspiring big-time authors might want to give a publisher a portfolio of other work such as poems and short stories, or other
        novels that the author made to get some good will with the publisher and have them grow their trust in your skills.
